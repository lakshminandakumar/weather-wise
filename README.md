<h1>Weather Wise App</h1> 

This is a simple demo weather app I've created using HTML, CSS & Javascript for testing purposes.

<h2>My Problem</h2>

As an enthusiastic software tester with special interest in test automation, I like to try out different test automation tools available in the market.
But I couldn't always find a way to get the application I was interested in running locally. So I decided that a simple demo application that is totally under my control is better.

<h2>My Solution</h2>

I built weather wise to experiment with different test automation frameworks, that is totally under my control.
I've built the app frontend using HTML, CSS & Javascript. It consumes the 3rd party API provided by [openweathermap.org](https://openweathermap.org/)</br>
<b><i>Note</i></b>: Create an account on openweathermap.org to get an api key.

The landing page is very simple with a rainbow background 🏳️‍🌈🌈

Depending on the weather conditions of the place, the app beackground changes!


<h2>Running the application locally</h2>

Step 1: Clone the repository
Step 2: Run npm i
Step 3: Add your api key to the env file 
Step 4: Run npm start
Step 5: Open the localhost on a browser
